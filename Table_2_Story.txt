There was once a small pear on the Eastern alps of France with nothing but a sick hairdo and an eye for fashion…
but his family lived back in Mexico and his cravings for enchiladas and chimichangas were strong so he decided to head back home for a change…
On his trip back to Mexico he met Bill Gates, Linus Torvalds and Tim Cook. They all like pears very much, so they decided to take Pierre the Pear on a quick little trip to the West Coast for a 'conference'. Ever since then Pierre has been in a petrified state not moving at all, never being able to go back to his family in Mexico. However, his keen eye on fashion and cultural pride are present even in his current state.
